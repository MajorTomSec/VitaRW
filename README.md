VitaShell One-click Installer for Near

Uses VitaRW, mounts vs0, replaces Near's eboot with VitaShell's, deletes app.db and reboots, forcing a db rebuild.

Meant to make a permanent copy of VitaShell that can be used even after a system format, to avoid issues like being in 3.65 without VitaShell and a VitaShell backup.

Just inject VitaShell to Near before formatting and keep it there. If you ever format and need it, it'll be there.
