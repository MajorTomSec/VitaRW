# VitaRW
Enable RW access to "read-only" partitions.
This is a PoC, and should be used by devs who like the risk.

Oh, sa0 isn't unmounted correctly there, fix it if you care.

No build provided, just in case any Indiana Jones kid would like to play with os0.

Thanks to SMOKE for taking the risk of modding some files in vs0 (That doesn't seem to cause any problem, btw.)

## Partitions mounted in RW

0x200= os0
0x300= vs0
0x400= vd0
0x500= tm0
0x700= ud0
0x800= sa0
0x900= gro0
0xC00= pd0
